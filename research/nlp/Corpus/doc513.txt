In film, reframing is a change in camera angle without a cut and can include changing the focus of the scene. The term has been more often used in film criticism than in actual cinema.  Critics of the technique include Andr√© Bazin among others.
In production or post-production, reframing can be used to change a sequence without having to reshoot. For example, zooming in on an actor to edit out nudity for a movie to be broadcast over the air.
Types of reframing can include: pan, tilt, zoom, crane or boom shot, dolly or trucking shot, handheld shot, tracking shot, and steadycam shot.

Notable films in which reframing is used
A Bug's Life
Citizen Kane
The Player
Pretty Baby
