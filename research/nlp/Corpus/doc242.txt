Cambo BV is a manufacturer of high quality, mainly large format cameras based in Kampen, the Netherlands, and has the distinction of being the first studio camera manufacturer to produce an all-metal large format camera.

History
The company was founded by Roelof Bok in 1945 in Hengelo, the Netherlands.
At the time the company was called Technica Hengelo. Trying to export the first produced camera 'Super Technica'  a confusion with Linhof Technica made it necessary to rethink the company's name to Cambo (CAMera BOk)
The company moved to Kampen in 1965.
In 1968, cambo obtained worldwide success by developing the multishot camera. This camera fitted with four lenses and hence is able to take four pictures at a time.
Since several years Cambo has expanded their product range into the market for Video supports.
