In telecommunication, an isochronous signal is a signal in which the time interval separating any two significant instants is equal to the unit interval or a multiple of the unit interval. Variations in the time intervals are constrained within specified limits.
"Isochronous" is a characteristic of one signal, while "synchronous" indicates a relationship between two or more signals.
