H. Bellieni et Fils was a camera maker in Nancy, France, from the late nineteenth century until the early twentieth century. Several jumelle-type cameras, including stereo models, are known to have been produced from the mid-1890s to 1905; older, wooden-bodied cameras are also seen.
The firm was founded by Henri Bellieni (1857–1938).
