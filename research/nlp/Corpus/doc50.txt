In telecommunication, a start signal is a signal that prepares a device to receive data or to perform a function. 
In asynchronous serial communication, start signals are used at the beginning of a character that prepares the receiving device for the reception of the code elements. 
A start signal is limited to one signal element usually having the duration of a unit interval.
