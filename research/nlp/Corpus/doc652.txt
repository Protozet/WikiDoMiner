History
Insta360 CEO JK Liu (刘靖康) met his co-founders while studying computer science at Nanjing University. Liu recognized the potential of 360 when he attended a music concert and wanted to develop products to record and share such powerfully moving events.Liu's first product was a smartphone app for live streaming, but he quickly expanded the firm's product portfolio by developing an accessory to turn a smartphone into a 360-degree camera.After graduating, Liu and his team moved to Shenzhen and founded Insta360 in 2015 to begin developing and manufacturing 360-degree cameras as they found the current market standard did not fulfill their needs. Insta360 later began to recognise the benefits of 360 video go far beyond standard 360 video, and began pioneering a new type of action camera, a 360 action camera that uses 360 video as a tool to create traditional flat framed content. This was with the first in the ONE series, Insta360 ONE.
Since then, Insta360 has also opened offices in Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Berlin and it hosts 500 employees globally.
In 2020, Insta360 entered a strategic partnership with Leica to help produce the ONE R 1-Inch Edition. Since then, ONE R has been recognised as one of TIME magazine's best inventions of 2020. A recent milestone for the company was Apple hosting Insta360 cameras in stores in over 100 countries.In 2018, NASA used Insta360 Pro and Pro 2 to live stream the landing of the InSight Mars Lander from mission control, winning an Emmy for the project. In 2021, NASA again used Insta360 Pro 2 to live stream from mission control when the Perseverance rover landed on Mars.
