Leidolf was a manufacturer of optical equipment situated in Wetzlar, Germany.  It was founded by Rudolf Leidolf in 1921, initially producing lenses for microscopes. In 1948 camera production was started and in 1962 the factory ceased operations. Leidolf is in no way related to Leitz (the manufacturer of Leica), even though Wetzlar has been the historical location for both companies.
