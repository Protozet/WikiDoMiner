Chaika (Russian: Чайка) was a series of Soviet 35mm half-frame cameras produced by BELOMO from 1965 to 1974. The name came from call sign of the first woman in space - Valentina Tereshkova.
Over 2 million Chaika cameras were produced. All models of the Chaika cameras have metal cases.
Chaika cameras share the following basic specifications:

Film used — 35-mm in standard cassette (135 type)
Frame size — 18×24 mm
Lens — Industar-69 (Tessar-type) ... mounted by LTM-like thread of 39 mm diameter.
Focal length 28 mm
Diaphragm scale from 2.8 to 16
Focusing: 0.8 m to infinite
Leaf shutter ... behind the lens
Adjustable shutter speeds 1/30 - 1/250 sec and "B"
Flash synchronisationFlange focal distance for the lens was shorter than the standard M39 mount used by early Leica and compatible cameras - 27.5mm compared to 28.8mm for Leica - and the lens will not focus to infinity on such bodies. The intention was to use the lens to enlarge the negatives, not interchangeability with other cameras or lenses.
