However, Banca Intermobiliare and sister bank FarBanca (of BPVi group) were excluded. On 6 July 2017, Veneto Banca made an open invitation to sell Banca Intermobiliare. In September 2018, Banca Intermobiliare approved the strategic plan for three-year (2019-2021).After being taken private, the bank was restructured and renamed Banca Investis in 2022.
