A revival house or repertory cinema is a cinema that specializes in showing classic or notable older films (as opposed to first run films).  Such venues may include standard repertory cinemas, multi-function theatres that alternate between old movies and live events, and some first-run theatres that show past favorites alongside current independent films.
